Summary:
A program to test for primality of any number (n). 
  
  TASK: Menu

A precise series of mathematical steps must be shown.
  
  TASK: Print and Comment each step.

Must be able to run on multiple numbers.
  
  TASK: Enter a number
  
  TASK: Cycle numbers
  
  TASK: View numbers

Test largest number that can be calculated within 10 minutes.
  
  TASK: Create timer

TEST:
  
  Is n even?
  
  Is n a multiple of a smaller prime number?
      divide n by the prime number.

    Write a description and step-by-step explanation of your algorithm. You may include a flowchart.
    Include the source code written in your chosen language, with ample comments to explain how it relates to the algorithm. You should include an explanation of the software platform you are using, such as the software made available through DeVry.
    Submit examples of the results obtained when the program was executed for specific test numbers, including whether or not the number is prime and the approximate execution time (your best estimate will be sufficient).
    Include your largest number tested and the estimated execution time.
    Describe any improvements you made to the original program that resulted in faster execution, if you have any.
    Submit your projection of how the execution time of your program will grow as the tested number N becomes larger.
